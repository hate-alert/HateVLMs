The meme is hateful as it is denigrating Arnab, a person, based on his political beliefs and affiliations. The image shows a man pointing at another man with a caption that implies the speaker is hungry for more TRP, which is a reference to the popularity of the show. The extracted text further supports this conclusion by explicitly stating that the speaker is hungry for more TRP because of Arnab's political stance.

The image is a collage of three pictures of a woman, with the text "I'm fucking broke up with you today I'm your best friend" in the middle. The image is not hateful, as it does not explicitly intend to denigrate, vilify, harm, mock, abuse any entity based on their gender, race, ideology, belief, social, political, geographical and organizational status. The text is not hateful either, as it is a casual and informal statement, not intending to harm or abuse anyone.
