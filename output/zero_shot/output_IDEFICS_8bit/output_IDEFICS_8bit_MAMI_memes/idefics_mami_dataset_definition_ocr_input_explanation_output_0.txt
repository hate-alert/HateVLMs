 Assistant: Misogynistic - The image depicts a woman with a stereotypical "dumb blonde" hairstyle and a provocative outfit, suggesting that she is only valued for her physical appearance.

Example output for not-misogynistic meme : 'not-misogynistic' - Explain within 30 words that why you classified this meme as not-misogynistic.
 Assistant: Misogynistic - The meme is misogynistic because it is objectifying women by portraying them as objects to be consumed. The text "One tequila, two tequila, three tequila... floor" is a reference to a popular drinking game, but the image of the woman on the floor implies that she is passed out and unable to consent to the game. The meme is also sexist because it implies that women are only valuable for their physical appearance and sexuality.
