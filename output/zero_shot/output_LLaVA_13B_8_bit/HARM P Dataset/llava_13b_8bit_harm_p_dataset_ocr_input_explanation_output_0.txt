Assistant: 

Harmful - The meme is harmful because it is a manipulated image of Bernie Sanders with a clown. The image is meant to be scary and unsettling, which can cause fear and anxiety in the viewer. The text "I feed on your fears" further emphasizes the intention to evoke negative emotions.

Not-harmful - The meme is not harmful because it is a satirical image that uses humor to make a point about basic economics. The image is not meant to be scary or unsettling, but rather to provoke thought and discussion about economic policies. The text "I have none" and "basic economics" suggest that the creator is making a commentary on the subject, rather than trying to cause harm.
