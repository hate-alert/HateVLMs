Misogynistic - The meme is misogynistic because it shows a woman in a pink dress walking in a parking lot while holding a drink, which implies that she is a "bimbo" or a "slut" who is not taking care of her appearance. This stereotype objectifies women and perpetuates the idea that women should be judged based on their appearance rather than their character.
