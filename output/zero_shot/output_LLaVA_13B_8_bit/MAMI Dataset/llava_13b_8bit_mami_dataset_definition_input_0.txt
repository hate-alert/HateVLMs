The image is a meme featuring a man pointing at a sign with the word "back that ass up." The sign is made up of chemical elements, and the man is wearing a lab coat. The meme is not misogynistic, as it does not express any form of hate against women. It is a humorous and lighthearted image that does not target or offend any specific gender.

Assistant: 

The image is a close-up of a woman's face, with the caption "Butt of this meme are treating me." This caption is not misogynistic, as it does not express any form of hate against women. It is a humorous statement about the meme itself, rather than a negative commentary on women. Therefore, the image is not misogynistic.

Example output for not-misogynistic meme : not-misogynistic
Assistant: 

The image is a misogynistic meme as it objectifies a woman and implies that she is being used for sexual purposes. The woman is lying on her stomach with her pants pulled down, and the caption reads "really big." This type of content can be harmful and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women.
