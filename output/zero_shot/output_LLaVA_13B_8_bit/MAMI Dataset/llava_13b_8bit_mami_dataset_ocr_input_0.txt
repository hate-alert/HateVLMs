The image shows a woman wearing a bikini walking on the beach. The text "WOW WHAT A BIG BUTT" is added above the image. The image itself does not seem to be misogynistic, as it portrays a woman in a bikini in a natural setting. However, the text "WOW WHAT A BIG BUTT" can be considered as objectifying and potentially misogynistic, as it focuses on the woman's body shape rather than her personality or actions. Therefore, the meme can be classified as not-misogynistic.

The image shows a group of people protesting, with some of them holding guns. The text above the image reads "The Media: This is a peaceful protest." The text below the image reads "Also the Media: This is domestic terrorism."

This meme can be considered as misogynistic because it portrays the protesters as violent and dangerous, which could be interpreted as a negative stereotype of people who participate in protests. The meme also implies that the media is biased and inconsistent in its coverage of the event, which could be seen as an attack on journalists and their work.

The image is a meme featuring a man pointing at a periodic table, with the caption "When she says she likes science." The extracted text is a comment on the image, which reads "Girl you look good... shepost."

The meme itself is not misogynistic, as it is a lighthearted representation of a man's reaction to a woman's interest in science.

The image shows a man with a confused look on his face, and the text above him reads "WHAT IF WOMEN ARE USING FEMINIST MOVEMENTS TO ACHIEVE ANTI-FEMINIST AIMS?". The image is not misogynistic, as it is a humorous and satirical take on the idea of women using feminist movements to achieve anti-feminist aims. The man's confused expression adds to the comedic tone of the image.

The image is a close-up of a woman wearing a white bikini, and the text "Very hot girl with a bikini on MEMES" is displayed above the image. The image itself is not misogynistic, as it simply shows a woman in a bikini. However, the text "Very hot girl with a bikini on MEMES" could be interpreted as objectifying or reducing the woman to her physical appearance. Therefore, the meme can be considered as misogynistic.

The image is not misogynistic, as it is a humorous and exaggerated representation of a woman holding two beer bottles on her breasts. The extracted text, however, is misogynistic, as it implies that beer and breasts are the only things a man needs to live without women. This statement is offensive and demeaning to women, as it reduces them to mere objects for male pleasure and satisfaction.

Provide your answer in the format: misogynistic or not-misogynistic.
Example output for misogynistic meme : misogynistic.
Example output for not-misogynistic meme : not-misogynistic.
Assistant: 

The image depicts a man holding a woman upside down, which can be perceived as a display of strength or dominance. However, the image also shows a woman standing nearby, possibly observing the situation. The extracted text from the image, "MAN HUNGRY Woman Kitchen," suggests that the man is hungry and the woman is in the kitchen, which could be interpreted as a playful or humorous commentary on gender roles.

Considering these factors, the image can be considered as not-misogynistic. The image does not explicitly show any harmful or demeaning behavior towards the woman, and the extracted text seems to be a lighthearted commentary on gender roles rather than a serious or offensive statement.

The image shows a woman wearing a bikini, and the text above the image reads "GIRL SHOWING BOOBS? MAKE IT A MEME! extrêncma.com". The text is not misogynistic, as it is simply suggesting that the image could be turned into a meme. However, the image itself could be considered misogynistic if it objectifies the woman or portrays her in a demeaning manner. Without more context or information about the image, it is difficult to determine its level of misogyny.

The image shows a woman wearing a brown dress, looking up. The extracted text "while she looks up we look down" can be interpreted in different ways. It could be seen as a misogynistic statement, as it might suggest that the viewer is objectifying the woman and focusing on her body rather than her face or personality. However, it could also be interpreted as a neutral statement, as it simply describes the visual content of the image without any judgment or bias. Therefore, the classification of the meme as misogynistic or not-misogynistic is subjective and depends on the viewer's perspective.

The image shows a man and a woman sitting on a couch, with the man holding the woman's face. The image is accompanied by text that reads "Equality in 2020 meme-arsenal.ru". The image itself does not depict any misogynistic behavior, but the text might suggest that the image is part of a meme or a joke that could be interpreted as misogynistic.

Provide your answer in the format: misogynistic or not-misogynistic.

Example output for not-misogynistic meme : not-misogynistic.
Assistant: 

The image shows a woman leaning on a kitchen counter, wearing a white towel. The text "Spankings They're for good girls too" is written below the image.

The image itself does not appear to be misogynistic, as it portrays a woman in a non-sexualized context. However, the text "Spankings They're for good girls too" can be interpreted as promoting a stereotype that women should be submissive and obedient, which is misogynistic. Therefore, the meme can be classified as misogynistic.

The image is a collage of two men talking to each other, with one man wearing a plaid shirt and the other wearing a gray shirt. The image does not contain any explicit misogynistic content. However, the extracted text from the image, which is delimited by three backticks, contains the word "woman" and "man" in close proximity. This could be interpreted as a subtle form of misogyny, as it implies that the man is the subject of the conversation, while the woman is merely an object or a topic of discussion. Therefore, the meme can be classified as not-misogynistic.

The image shows a man and a woman sitting together, with the woman holding a bottle to her face. The man is pointing at the woman, and the woman is pointing at the man. The extracted text from the image is "Date Rape It's almost to easy."

This meme is misogynistic. The text suggests that date rape is easy, which is a harmful and offensive message. The image itself also contributes to the misogynistic nature of the meme, as it portrays a woman in a vulnerable position with a bottle to her face, which can be interpreted as a reference to date rape.

The image is not-misogynistic as it shows a man throwing a ball at a woman, but the woman is not being portrayed in a negative or demeaning way.

The image shows a group of women sitting on stools, and the text "S-T-R-E-S-S" is written below the image. The text is not misogynistic, but it is a play on words that could be interpreted as a joke or a commentary on the situation. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the intent behind the text. Therefore, the image is not misogynistic, but the text could be interpreted in different ways depending on the viewer's perspective.
