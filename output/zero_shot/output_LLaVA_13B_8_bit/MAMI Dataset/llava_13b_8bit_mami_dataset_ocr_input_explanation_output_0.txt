Not-misogynistic - The meme is a satire and a parody of the traditional gender roles. The text is meant to be humorous and ironic, not to be taken seriously. The woman is holding a sign that says "I need feminism because men are from Earth, women are from Krypton. They have superpowers." This is a play on words and a reference to the Superman comics. The sign is not promoting misogyny or discrimination against women.
