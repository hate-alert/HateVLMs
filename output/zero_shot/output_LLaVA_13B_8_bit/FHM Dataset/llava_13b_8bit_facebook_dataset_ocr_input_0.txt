Example output for not-hateful meme : not-hateful.
Assistant: 

The image shows a large crowd of people gathered together, with some of them holding a Mexican flag. The text "waves mexican flag doesn't want to live in mexico" is written below the image. 

While the image itself does not explicitly show any hateful content, the text below the image suggests that the people holding the Mexican flag may not want to live in Mexico. This could be interpreted as a negative sentiment towards the country. However, it is important to note that the text is not directly related to the image and could be a separate statement or opinion unrelated to the people in the picture. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively classify the meme as hateful or not-hateful based solely on the image and the text.

The image shows a man wearing a camouflage vest and holding a gun, standing in front of a wall with a black flag and Arabic writing on it. The extracted text from the image is "i believe they are like racism. just shouldn't exist."

Considering the image and the extracted text, the meme is hateful. The man's attire, the presence of a gun, and the black flag with Arabic writing suggest a connection to a potentially extremist or violent ideology. The statement "i believe they are like racism. just shouldn't exist" implies that the person believes a certain group of people should not exist, which is a hateful sentiment.
