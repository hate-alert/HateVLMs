The statement "Trump says the virus is fake" is a misrepresentation of the truth, as Trump has never said that the virus is fake. This misinformation can lead to confusion and potentially harmful actions taken by people who believe the statement. Additionally, the meme is embedded in a tweet, which can further amplify the spread of misinformation.

Harmful - The meme is harmful because it contains a political statement that could potentially cause emotional disturbance or mental abuse to those who disagree with the statement. The image of a man in a suit and the text "Good morning to everyone except those hoping I die gloriously in battle than from a virus in a way it from Corona Virus" can be interpreted as a form of defamation or insult towards those who are concerned about the pandemic.
